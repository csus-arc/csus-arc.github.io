These are my class notes from when I took Dr. Mark Basgall's California Archaeology class back in 1999. This was a great class and there was a ton of useful information for someone starting out in California archaeology. After getting my master's degree at Sac State, I worked at a series of CRM jobs, and each time I started work in a new area or had to write a report background section, I would pull out the ANTH 196R binder and check what Mark had said, then move on to Moratto, the Chartkoffs, Jones and Klar and other key references before diving into the local literature. 

At some point, I started to worry that if I ever lost the binder, all would be lost so I decided to type up my notes so I could have an electronic copy just in case. This was of course early days of the internet and cloud storage wasn't really a thing yet, so this file lived on my computer hard drives, floppy disks, zip disks, cds, usb drives, then finally here. I transcribed about 20 pages of the notes over the years, working on it whenever I could but eventually running out of steam. Then, in 2016, I had to teach California Archaeology for the first time at Sac State, so in addition to great lecture notes provided to me by Dr. Basgall, guess which binder I dug up to remember the structure of the class? 

Fast-forward to 2024 over winter break, I was getting ready to teach California Archaeology again in the Spring and I was feeling pretty down about all the recent legislative changes in California that spelled the imminent loss and destruction of many priceless prehistoric California archaeological collections. At the same time, activists, lobbyists, lawmakers, and many regular citizens who thought they were doing the right thing were making it difficult or impossible to teach the next generation of California archaeologists by trying to prevent the use of artifacts, photos, artifact casts, and other objects as teaching materials. The public mood, it seemed, had turned from curiosity about the past and support of science, to an ill-defined "decolonial" agenda that seemed unlikely to include any actual decolonization.

I was worried that the kinds of information I learned about all those years ago in Dr. Basgall's class would not be available to future generations so I decided to finally spend the time to transcribe the rest of the notes from that 1999 semester. After a few weeks of fairly steady work, this is the result -about 60 pages of notes. Even though a lot has happened in California archaeology since 1999, I still think any student of prehistoric (precolonial) California could do worse than starting here.
