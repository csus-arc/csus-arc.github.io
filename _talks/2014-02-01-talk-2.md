This is a map of commonly understood California archaeological regions. It is not exactly environment based but partly that and partly based on where large amount of archaeological work has occurred (mostly related to development). So the San Francisco Bay area, Santa Barbara Channel, Inyo-Mono, and South Coast get singled out on those grounds while other regions like the Sierra Nevada and Central Valley are more environment-based.
